Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room and they currently had an Android application of their game, Draw It or Lose It. They were requesting a software design for the application that would allow them to offer the game on multiple platforms.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I provided comprehensive information to each section prompt of the document.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found it helpful to work through the code in sections that were related to the design document.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the OS platform comparison chart. I would make the comparisions more project-specific for the client.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs based on the guidelines provided in the learning sections of the course. Considering the user's needs when designing is the ultimate goal because the user will be the one operating the application that is being designed.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software with the idea to utilize practices that I have experienced in past courses that were successful but also with an open mind to the specific idea that we learned each week throughout the course. I would definitely look at multiple architectures and options when beginning the design process and narrow down the options based on the client and user's requirements and needs until the best strategy was identified.
